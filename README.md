Seawolf is a submarine game that is hosted on one computer that is running the game application. In order to play the game users go to [Controller Web Application](https://seawolf-server.herokuapp.com) and input the game id they want to join. If that game exists, a submarine will be added to the game application that the person on the controller website will control. Players have 4 lives. They move using a joystick on the left of the screen. On the write along with the weapon buttons there is also a button to toggle submerge. They can shoot torpedos and drop mines currently. Seeking missiles is another planned feature.
